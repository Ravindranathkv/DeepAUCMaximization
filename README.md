# DeepAUCMaximization

Deep AUC Maximization (DAM) is a powerful technique for training deep neural networks that involves optimizing the AUC score on a given dataset. While DAM has shown impressive results in medical image classification, it can be prone to overfitting on smaller datasets, leading to poor generalization performance. The goal of this project is to investigate ways to improve the generalization ability of DAM on medical image classification tasks.

To achieve this, we will conduct experiments on seven medical image classification tasks from the MedMNIST website using the LibAUC library. We will compare our results with the benchmark performance reported in the MedMNIST paper and other state-of-the-art methods using the ResNet 18 ( ResNet 18-3D for 3D datasets) backbone structure as in the MedMNIST paper to ensure a fair comparison. We will also experiment with different hyperparameters and techniques to improve the generalization ability of DAM.

Our experiments will provide valuable insights into the potential of DAM for medical image classification and its limitations. We will report our results in terms of AUC score and test accuracy, providing a robust measure of classification performance that is insensitive to class imbalance.

In conclusion, this project aims to improve the generalization ability of DAM for medical image classification tasks and provides valuable insights into the potential of this technique. Please see our documentation for more details on our experimental setup and results.
